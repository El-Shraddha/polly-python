# Indended use
This space is intended to help [polly-python](https://pypi.org/project/polly-python/) users for the following:-
1. Share example notebooks to answer frequently asked questions of Polly users and enable consumption. The notebooks can be opened directly on the Polly compute environment.
2. Raise issue for any feature requests or bugs they encounter while using polly-python.
3. Discuss the key features being planned in polly-python product roadmap and provide feedback to team.

## How are the notebooks, issues and roadmap organized?
Most of the notebooks are organized as per the IDEATE Framework of Elucidata.

- **Ingest:** Enable users to bring their data as well as context to Polly. Context is as important as the data itself as it helps us to identify users' needs more accurately as well as it will help users to navigate Polly more efficiently.
- **Discover:** Enable users to search/query for datasets of their interest.
- **Enrich:** Enable users to enrich the data with public databases and navigate smoothly across the data from different sources.  
- **Analyse:** Enable users to build a collection of tools, notebooks, apps, and ML models used in bioinformatics.
- **Communicate:**  Enable users to share the data, analysis, reports etc with colleagues to share and collaborate better.
